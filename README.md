Professor X has decided to replace Cerebro with a new social media site called X-Facebook where X-Men can check out each other's profiles online. He's created high fidelity wireframes that you can check out below. It's your job to build them.

## Getting Started
- Fork and clone this repo.
- **DO NOT** type `create-react-app`. The React app is already provided in this repository.
- `cd` into your cloned repo and use `npm i` to install dependencies. `Axios` and `react-router-dom` have already been provided.
- Set up `Router` in your `index.js` file.
- Turn your `App.js` file into a class component.

## Component Heirarchy
Your finished app should have a heirarchy as follows:

```js
<App /> 
  - <Header />
  - <main></main>
    - <Heroes /> // page with all the heroes
    - <Profile /> // page with selected hero
  - <Footer />
```

## Getting Heroes 
Let's start with the `<Heroes />` Component

## Wireframes

#### Heroes Page
If you click on a hero, it should take you to their profile page.
